# NOS Week 2
Python Fundamentals

The TA told me to start at exercize 6, the password checker. I did this, used flags to check if the password is valid, and refactored my code so error messages would always fit.
Ceaser Cipher and Hangman were pretty straightforward to make.

# NOS Week 3
Application Layer in Networks

We started by getting the IP address from a website, then used tracert to trace the network route packages take. It wasn't very illuminating until we used our own wifi.

Exercize 1: I did this for multiple websites
Exercize 2: I did this also for multiple sites
Exercize 3: Once I stopped using Eduroam, my output did look like that. Over repeated traces, it got faster.
Exercize 4: There were some connections which timed out or took a very long time, but over repeated traces this improved.
Exercize 5: I wasn't able to change my location effectively in the lab.

We built an HTTP client to fetch data, then used requests to do so much easier.

Finally we used HTTP Requests to POST, PUT, and DELETE data.

# NOS Week 4
Transport Layer in Networks

We made a UDP Server and Client, and made it so they could speak together. We then added a dictionary with the user's IP address, and added authentication.
